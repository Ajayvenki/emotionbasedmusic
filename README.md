## Use case: 
Although it does not add any potential values to the business or solves a real time problems. It was fun to create a project based on generative AI models and concepts:

    - In-House built 💼.
    - Private and secure 🔒.
    - Zero 0️⃣ cost 💸 on the inference. 
    - Captures the emotion in various mediums (Text, voice, image, attachment)
    - Runs based on open source models🤖 (Mistal-7B)
    - Capable to extract emotions from hand written ✍🏼 images via OCR.

To keep the solution very simple, the music generation does not honour the languages, choice of music, artist selection etc.
